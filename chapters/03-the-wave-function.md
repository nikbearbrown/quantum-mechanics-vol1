# Chapter 3 — The Wave Function and Born's Rule

In Chapter 0 we built a simulation that displayed a blue filled curve drifting across the screen, with an orange oscillating curve running through it. Those curves were plots of the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ — specifically, $|\psi|^2$ in blue and $\mathrm{Re}\,\psi$ in orange. This chapter gives the precise physical meaning of the wave function and establishes the rule that connects it to measurable quantities.

We begin with a question that forces us to be precise: what are the units of $|\psi|^2$?

The particle moves along a line measured in nanometers, and $|\psi|^2$ is plotted against that line, so it carries units. The key point is that $|\psi|^2$ is not a probability — it is a probability *per nanometer*, a density. The distinction matters. You cannot read "the particle is at position $x$" from the value of $|\psi|^2$ at a single point, any more than you can read a city's population from a density map at one address. To extract a probability — a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 — you must integrate over a region.

That integration defines the Born rule. Given a wave function $\psi(x,t)$, the probability of finding the particle in the interval $[a,b]$ at time $t$ is:

$$P\bigl(\text{particle in }[a,b]\bigr) = \int_a^b |\psi(x,t)|^2\,dx.$$

Max Born introduced this in 1926, in a paper on quantum scattering. His original draft wrote the probability as proportional to $\psi$ itself — not $|\psi|^2$. In a footnote added in proof, he corrected it. That footnote is one of the most consequential edits in the history of physics. Born received the Nobel Prize in 1954 for the statistical interpretation it introduced.

*Figure 3.1 — timeline showing Born's 1926 paper → footnote correction → Nobel 1954, with the two expressions ψ and |ψ|² side by side*

Because $|\psi|^2$ is a density measured per unit length, it can take values greater than 1. Treating the value of the density at a point as a probability is a unit error. The distinction between probability density and probability is fundamental and should be clear before proceeding.

---

A second important question is why $\psi$ must be complex. If what we observe is $|\psi|^2$, which is real and non-negative, why not use a real-valued function and discard the imaginary part?

The equation of motion rules this out. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is:

$$i\hbar \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \hat{H}\psi.$$

The factor $i$ on the left side is structural. If $\psi$ were purely real, then $\partial\psi/\partial t$ would be real, and $i\hbar$ times a real number is purely imaginary. The left side would be imaginary while the right side is real (for real $\psi$ and real $V$), which is impossible unless both sides are zero. The Schrödinger equation itself requires $\psi$ to take complex values. A real wave function would have no consistent dynamics.

In the simulation from Chapter 0, the orange curve showed $\mathrm{Re}\,\psi$ and the gray dashed curve showed $\mathrm{Im}\,\psi$. Both parts were non-trivial, with the imaginary part leading the real part by a quarter cycle. If the imaginary part were set to zero and a single time step taken under the Schrödinger equation, the imaginary part would immediately regenerate. The two parts are inseparable.

*Figure 3.2 — three-panel SVG showing Re ψ (orange), Im ψ (gray dashed), and |ψ|² (blue filled) for a Gaussian wave packet with k₀ ≠ 0, making the…*

To see what information the imaginary part carries, consider the Gaussian wave packet with central momentum $\hbar k_0$:

$$\psi(x) = A\,e^{-x^2/(2a^2)}\,e^{ik_0 x}.$$

Separate the real and imaginary parts:

$$\text{Re}\,\psi = A\,e^{-x^2/(2a^2)}\cos(k_0 x), \qquad \text{Im}\,\psi = A\,e^{-x^2/(2a^2)}\sin(k_0 x).$$

Both oscillate, and both carry the information encoded in $k_0$. Now compute the density:

$$|\psi|^2 = A^2\,e^{-x^2/a^2}.$$

The oscillations vanish. The density is a smooth Gaussian with no trace of $k_0$ anywhere. The momentum — the direction of travel, the central velocity — is invisible in $|\psi|^2$. It lives entirely in the phase, in the relationship between $\mathrm{Re}\,\psi$ and $\mathrm{Im}\,\psi$. Discard the imaginary part and you can no longer tell a wave packet moving right from one moving left. Both would have the same $|\psi|^2$, and both would look identical in every experimental histogram of position measurements.

This is not a mathematical subtlety. The physical content of the imaginary part is that it carries information about the direction of motion. Without it, $\psi$ cannot represent a moving particle.

---

A common misconception about the wave function concerns what the spreading of $|\psi|^2$ over time means. When the blue probability density in the simulation spreads wider, it is tempting to read this as the particle physically expanding. That reading is incorrect. When the particle is detected, it is found at one definite location. What spreads is the *probability distribution* of where that location might be. If the same experiment — same initial conditions, same Hamiltonian, same $\psi(x,0)$ — were repeated many times, the histogram of measured positions would match $|\psi|^2$. The spread of that histogram is what grows.

The wave function is not the particle. It is the rule for computing probability distributions.

This is the content of Born's interpretation: compute $|\psi|^2$, integrate over a region, obtain the probability of finding the particle there. Each individual measurement yields a single definite outcome; $|\psi|^2$ gives the distribution of outcomes over many repetitions of the same preparation.

---

Since $|\psi|^2$ is a probability density and the particle must be found somewhere, normalization requires:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(x,t)|^2\,dx = 1.$$

A wave function satisfying this condition is normalized. In practice, wave functions are often written without normalization constants. To normalize $\tilde{\psi}$, compute $\int|\tilde{\psi}|^2\,dx$, take its square root, and divide.

An important question is whether normalization is preserved under time evolution. If $\psi$ is normalized at $t = 0$ and satisfies the Schrödinger equation, does $\int|\psi|^2\,dx$ remain equal to 1 for all $t$? It must, since otherwise the probability of finding the particle anywhere would drift from 1 — an incoherent result. We can prove this is guaranteed.

We differentiate $\int|\psi|^2\,dx$ with respect to time and use the Schrödinger equation to replace $\partial_t\psi$ and $\partial_t\psi^*$. The potential energy terms cancel exactly. The kinetic terms combine into a perfect derivative in $x$:

$$\frac{\partial|\psi|^2}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial J}{\partial x},$$

where

$$J(x,t) = \frac{\hbar}{m}\,\mathrm{Im}\!\left(\psi^*\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\right).$$

*Figure 3.3 — conservation law analogy — fluid continuity equation alongside the quantum probability continuity equation, showing structural identity*

This is the **continuity equation** for probability, with the same mathematical structure as the continuity equation for mass, charge, or any other conserved quantity. Probability flows with current $J$. Integrating over all $x$: the boundary terms at $\pm\infty$ vanish for any normalizable $\psi$, giving $\frac{d}{dt}\int|\psi|^2\,dx = 0$. Normalization is preserved at all times.

This result has a practical consequence for numerical simulations. If $\int|\psi|^2\,dx$ drifts away from 1 during a time evolution, something is wrong: either the time-stepping scheme is non-unitary (explicit Euler has this problem) or probability is leaking at the grid boundaries. The normalization indicator we required in Chapter 0 is precisely this diagnostic, and the conservation law just proved is its theoretical basis.

Born's rule provides the probability distribution for position measurements. The expectation value of position — the average over many measurements of the same state — is the mean of the distribution $|\psi|^2$:

$$\langle x\rangle = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x\,|\psi(x,t)|^2\,dx.$$

Momentum expectation values require more care. In position space, momentum is not a function of $x$; the expression $\langle p\rangle = \int p\,|\psi(x)|^2\,dx$ is not well-defined. The correct route is through the Fourier transform: define $\phi(p,t)$ as the Fourier transform of $\psi(x,t)$. Then $|\phi(p,t)|^2$ is the probability density for momentum measurements, and $\langle p\rangle = \int p\,|\phi|^2\,dp$. Using Parseval's theorem to translate this back to position space, multiplication by $p$ becomes differentiation. The momentum operator in position space is:

$$\hat{p} = -i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial x}.$$

The sign here is not a convention that can be reversed. For a wave packet with central wavenumber $k_0 > 0$, moving to the right, this operator gives $\langle p\rangle = \hbar k_0 > 0$. Writing $\hat{p} = +i\hbar\,\partial_x$ instead would reverse all directions — a sign error that the simulation detects immediately: a rightward-moving packet would register negative average momentum.

<!-- → [TABLE: side-by-side comparison of position-space and momentum-space Born rule — rows: density, normalization condition, expectation value formula, operator form] -->

---

We can also characterize the spreads of the position and momentum distributions. Define the standard deviations in the usual way:

$$\sigma_x = \sqrt{\langle x^2\rangle - \langle x\rangle^2}, \qquad \sigma_p = \sqrt{\langle p^2\rangle - \langle p\rangle^2}.$$

The **Kennard inequality**, proved by E. H. Kennard in 1927, states:

$$\sigma_x\,\sigma_p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}.$$

To understand what this inequality says, consider the following experimental procedure. Prepare many identical copies of the same state $\psi$. Measure position on half and record the standard deviation $\sigma_x$. Measure momentum on the other half and record $\sigma_p$. No particle is measured twice, and no measurement disturbs any other. The Kennard inequality states that the product $\sigma_x\sigma_p$ cannot be smaller than $\hbar/2$, regardless of the state.

The source of this bound is Fourier analysis, not physical disturbance. A function narrow in $x$ must have a broad Fourier transform, and vice versa. The Kennard inequality is the exact, rigorous expression of this mathematical relationship, with $\hbar/2$ as the precise lower bound.

A separate result, the Heisenberg measurement-disturbance relation, governs what happens when position and momentum are measured sequentially on the *same* particle. It has a different form, a different bound, and a different physical content. Ozawa formalized it in 2003, and Erhart et al. tested it experimentally in 2012. The two results are distinct and should not be conflated.

The Gaussian wave packet saturates the Kennard bound. For

$$\psi(x) = (\pi a^2)^{-1/4}\,e^{-x^2/(2a^2)}\,e^{ik_0x},$$

a direct calculation gives:

$$\sigma_x = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \qquad \sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}\,a}, \qquad \sigma_x\sigma_p = \frac{\hbar}{2}.$$

The product is exactly $\hbar/2$. Every other normalizable state gives a strictly larger product. The Gaussian is the minimum-uncertainty state — the unique state that achieves the lower bound.

The trade-off is direct: $\sigma_x \propto a$ and $\sigma_p \propto 1/a$. Decreasing $a$ narrows the wave packet spatially and proportionally widens it in momentum. The product remains fixed. This is a consequence of Fourier analysis, not of any technological limitation. No experimental technique can circumvent it.

## Worked Example — Normalizing an Exponential Wave Function

We now apply the Born rule to a specific case. Consider the un-normalized wave function $\tilde{\psi}(x) = e^{-|x|/a}$ for real $a > 0$. To normalize it, we compute:

$$A^2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-2|x|/a}\,dx = 2A^2\int_0^{\infty}e^{-2x/a}\,dx.$$

The split at $x = 0$ is necessary because $e^{-|x|/a} \neq e^{-x/a}$ for $x < 0$. Evaluating:

$$2A^2\cdot\frac{a}{2} = A^2 a = 1 \implies A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}.$$

Units check: with $x$ in nm and $a$ in nm, $A$ has units of $\text{nm}^{-1/2}$, so $|\psi|^2$ has units of $\text{nm}^{-1}$. This is correct for a one-dimensional probability density.

The probability of finding the particle in $[-a, a]$ is:

$$P = \frac{1}{a}\int_{-a}^{a}e^{-2|x|/a}\,dx = \frac{2}{a}\int_0^{a}e^{-2x/a}\,dx = 1 - e^{-2} \approx 0.865.$$

About 86.5% of the probability is in the central interval. The remaining 14% is in the tails $|x| > a$.

Note that at $x = 0$, $|\psi(0)|^2 = 1/a$. For $a = 0.5$ nm this equals 2 $\text{nm}^{-1}$, a number greater than 1. This is not a problem. The density is measured in $\text{nm}^{-1}$ and has no requirement to remain below 1. Expecting $|\psi|^2 \leq 1$ everywhere is a units error, equivalent to expecting a population density map to never exceed one person per square kilometer.

---

The wave function $e^{-|x|/a}$ is real-valued, so $\mathrm{Im}\,\psi = 0$ everywhere and the probability current $J = (\hbar/m)\,\mathrm{Im}(\psi^*\,\partial_x\psi)$ vanishes everywhere. A real wave function has zero probability current and cannot describe a particle with net momentum in any direction. To give the particle a central momentum $p_0$, we multiply by $e^{ip_0 x/\hbar}$. The density $|\psi|^2$ is unchanged, but $\langle p\rangle = p_0$. The spatial distribution is the same; the current is nonzero; the physics is different. The directional information is entirely contained in the phase.

Justify each in one sentence. *What this tests: reading physical information out of the phase.*

3. *[Probability current for a real wave function]* For a real-valued $\psi$, show directly from $J = (\hbar/m)\,\mathrm{Im}(\psi^*\,\partial_x\psi)$ that $J = 0$ everywhere. Then state what this implies: can a real $\psi$ describe a particle with net momentum in one direction? *What this tests: connection between phase and current.*

**Application**

4. *[Expectation values for a non-Gaussian state]* For the infinite-square-well ground state $\psi_1(x) = \sqrt{2/L}\,\sin(\pi x/L)$ on $[0,L]$: (a) compute $\langle x\rangle$ and $\sigma_x$ by direct integration; (b) compute $\langle p\rangle$ using $\hat{p} = -i\hbar\,\partial_x$ and explain why $\langle p\rangle = 0$ makes sense for a standing wave. *What this tests: applying expectation value machinery to a state that is not a Gaussian.*

5. *[Kennard inequality: preparation vs. disturbance]* A professor claims: "If I measure a particle's position very precisely, I must have disturbed its momentum. That is the uncertainty principle." Write a two-paragraph response. First paragraph: what is physically correct in this claim. Second paragraph: what is wrong, and what the Kennard inequality actually says. *What this tests: distinguishing the state-space inequality from the measurement-disturbance argument.*

6. *[Units and dimensional reasoning]* A wave function is tabulated numerically with $x$ in meters. The peak of $|\psi|^2$ at $t = 0$ reads $3.2 \times 10^9$ $\text{m}^{-1}$. (a) Is this a valid probability density? (b) Estimate the probability of finding the particle within $\pm 0.1$ nm of the peak, treating $|\psi|^2$ as roughly constant over that interval. (c) Someone says the wave function is "unnormalized by a factor of 2." What does this mean precisely, and what is the corrected peak density? *What this tests: facility with units throughout a calculation.*

**Synthesis**

7. *[Born rule in momentum space]* Define $\phi(p) = (1/\sqrt{2\pi\hbar})\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\psi(x)\,e^{-ipx/\hbar}\,dx$. For the Gaussian $\psi(x) = (\pi a^2)^{-1/4}\,e^{-x^2/(2a^2)}\,e^{ik_0 x}$, show by direct Fourier transform that $\phi(p)$ is a Gaussian centered at $\hbar k_0$ with width $\hbar/a$. Verify $\int|\phi|^2\,dp = 1$. *What this tests: carrying the Born rule from position space into momentum space and confirming the Gaussian saturates the Kennard bound.*

8. *[Continuity equation and wave-packet motion]* The continuity equation reads $\partial_t|\psi|^2 = -\partial_x J$. (a) Suppose $J > 0$ over some interval $[a,b]$ and zero outside. Sketch how $|\psi|^2$ evolves near that interval over a short $\delta t$. (b) Suppose $J > 0$ on the left half and $J < 0$ on the right half of the interval. Where does $|\psi|^2$ increase? Decrease? (c) Use this reasoning, without equations, to explain why a wave packet moving right has $J > 0$ in the high-probability region. *What this tests: reading the continuity equation as a spatial flow, not just a conservation identity.*

**Challenge**

9. *[Limits of the formalism]* The plane wave $\psi(x) = e^{ikx}$ has $|\psi|^2 = 1$ everywhere. (a) Show it cannot be normalized on $(-\infty,\infty)$. (b) Compute $\langle p\rangle$ formally using $\hat{p} = -i\hbar\,\partial_x$. (c) In what sense is the plane wave a state of "definite momentum $\hbar k$"? In what sense is this problematic, given the Born rule? (d) Propose how plane waves could serve as building blocks for normalizable wave functions. (This is the direction Chapter 4 develops.) *What this tests: honest confrontation with the formal limits of position-space normalization, and the direction toward Fourier synthesis.*
