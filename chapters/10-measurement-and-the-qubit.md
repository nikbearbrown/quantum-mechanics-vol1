# Chapter 10 — Measurement, Superposition, and the Qubit

In this chapter we examine what happens when we make a measurement in quantum mechanics. The question is a practical one: when we run an experiment and get a result, what rules governed that outcome? We will state those rules precisely, apply them to two-level systems called qubits, and examine what the formalism says — and does not say — about what happens to the system during a measurement.

## The Measurement Postulate

Let $\hat{A}$ be a Hermitian observable with discrete eigenvalues $\{a_n\}$ and orthonormal eigenstates $\{|a_n\rangle\}$. When we measure $\hat{A}$ on a system in state $|\psi\rangle$, three things happen:

**1.** The only possible outcomes are the eigenvalues $a_n$. Nothing in between them, no superposition of them — exactly one.

**2.** The probability of getting $a_n$ is

$$\boxed{P(a_n) = |\langle a_n|\psi\rangle|^2.}$$

This is the Born rule. The inner product $\langle a_n|\psi\rangle$ is a complex amplitude, and its modulus squared is the probability. Geometrically, $P(a_n)$ is the squared projection of $|\psi\rangle$ onto $|a_n\rangle$.

**3.** Immediately after the measurement returns $a_n$, the state is $|a_n\rangle$.

This is collapse. It is not a metaphor but a state-update rule.

The probabilities sum to 1 by the completeness of the eigenstates:

$$\sum_n P(a_n) = \sum_n |\langle a_n|\psi\rangle|^2 = \langle\psi|\!\left(\sum_n |a_n\rangle\langle a_n|\right)\!|\psi\rangle = \langle\psi|\hat{I}|\psi\rangle = 1.$$

Nothing leaks. The interpretation of collapse is contested. The practical content, however, is settled: after obtaining outcome $a_n$, we predict all subsequent measurements using $|a_n\rangle$.

## The Two-State System

The simplest system in which all of this is computable by hand is the qubit, a two-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^2$. We choose a basis $\{|0\rangle, |1\rangle\}$. The most general normalized state is

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle, \qquad \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, \qquad |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.$$

Two real parameters specify the state, up to a global phase. An electron's spin, a photon's polarization, the two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit — all are physical qubits, and the mathematics is identical for all of them.

The standard observables on a qubit are the Pauli operators:

$$\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}0 & -i\\i & 0\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\\0 & -1\end{pmatrix}.$$

Each is Hermitian, each squares to the identity, and each has eigenvalues $\pm 1$. Their commutators are $[\sigma_i, \sigma_j] = 2i\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k$, so for example $[\sigma_x, \sigma_z] = -2i\sigma_y \neq 0$. They do not commute, which means measuring one after another in different orders gives different results.

A word of caution about $\sigma_y$: the upper-right entry is $-i$, not $+i$. This is the single most common sign error in qubit calculations. The matrix is Hermitian even though it looks antisymmetric as a real matrix, because Hermitian means equal to the *conjugate* transpose. The transpose of $\sigma_y$ is $-\sigma_y$, but the conjugate transpose is $+\sigma_y$, and the $i$ is what makes that work. Any code doing qubit calculations should check $\sigma_y^\dagger = \sigma_y$ at startup.

## The Stern-Gerlach Experiment

In 1922, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach passed silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field. Classical physics predicted a smear — a continuous spread of deflections matching the continuous range of magnetic-moment orientations. What they saw instead was two discrete spots.

The field gradient exerts a force proportional to $\mu_z$, the component of the magnetic moment along the field axis. If angular momentum were classical, $\mu_z$ would be continuous and the deposit on the plate would be a streak. Instead there were two spots, at $\mu_z = \pm\mu_B$. The Born rule is not abstract here. It is written in silver.

The observable is $\hat{S}_z = (\hbar/2)\sigma_z$, with eigenvalues $\pm\hbar/2$. An atom in state $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|\!\uparrow\rangle + \beta|\!\downarrow\rangle$ hits the upper spot with probability $|\alpha|^2$ and the lower with $|\beta|^2$. If we let only the upper beam through, the remaining atoms are in state $|\!\uparrow\rangle$ — collapsed, certain, ready to be used again.

The interesting physics shows up in sequences. Consider three arrangements:

**Z then Z.** Select the $|\!\uparrow\rangle$ beam from a first Z apparatus and feed it into a second. Every atom hits the upper spot, with probability 1. Once we know the outcome of a $\hat{S}_z$ measurement, measuring $\hat{S}_z$ again gives the same result — collapse is stable.

**Z then X.** The $\hat{S}_x$ eigenstates are $|\pm x\rangle = (|\!\uparrow\rangle \pm |\!\downarrow\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. An atom in $|\!\uparrow\rangle$ is an equal superposition of both $\hat{S}_x$ eigenstates, so a subsequent X measurement comes out 50/50. The atom that was certainly spin-up in Z is completely uncertain in X.

**Z then X then Z.** After the X measurement, the state collapses to $|+x\rangle$ or $|-x\rangle$. Either way, that state is a 50/50 superposition in Z, since $|+x\rangle = (|\!\uparrow\rangle + |\!\downarrow\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. The final Z measurement is again random. The intermediate X measurement erased the Z information. Measure Z, then X, then Z, and the Z certainty is gone.

This is not instrumental imprecision. It is $[\sigma_x, \sigma_z] \neq 0$ made physically tangible. We cannot hold definite values for both observables at once.

## The Bloch Sphere

Every normalized qubit state, up to a global phase, can be written as

$$|\psi\rangle = \cos\!\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin\!\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)|1\rangle, \qquad \theta \in [0, \pi], \quad \phi \in [0, 2\pi).$$

The factor $\theta/2$ — not $\theta$ — is required. We can check it: at $\theta = 0$ we get $|0\rangle$; at $\theta = \pi$ we get $e^{i\phi}|1\rangle$, which is $|1\rangle$ up to a global phase; and at $\theta = \pi/2$ we get the equatorial state $(|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$. Use $\theta$ instead of $\theta/2$ and the south pole appears at $\theta = \pi/2$ rather than $\theta = \pi$, throwing everything off.

Each state corresponds to a point on the unit sphere through its Bloch vector:

$$\vec{r} = \bigl(\langle\sigma_x\rangle,\, \langle\sigma_y\rangle,\, \langle\sigma_z\rangle\bigr) = (\sin\theta\cos\phi,\, \sin\theta\sin\phi,\, \cos\theta).$$

North pole ($\theta = 0$): state $|0\rangle$, $\langle\sigma_z\rangle = +1$. South pole ($\theta = \pi$): state $|1\rangle$, $\langle\sigma_z\rangle = -1$. Equator ($\theta = \pi/2$): equal superpositions, $\langle\sigma_z\rangle = 0$. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is the relative phase between $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, and it is physically real: different values of $\phi$ at the same $\theta$ give different $\langle\sigma_x\rangle$ and $\langle\sigma_y\rangle$, detectable by the right measurement. The global phase is unobservable; the relative phase is not.

For pure states, $|\vec{r}|^2 = 1$ exactly. This makes a useful runtime check: compute the three expectation values and confirm the Bloch vector has unit length.

The factor $\theta/2$ in the state produces $\theta$ on the sphere through double-angle identities. It also means that a full $2\pi$ rotation of the state vector corresponds to only a $\pi$ rotation of the Bloch vector — the state picks up a factor of $-1$, invisible in expectation values but visible in interference. Neutron interferometry has measured it.

## Worked Example — Predicting Measurement Statistics

Let

$$|\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|0\rangle + \frac{i}{2}|1\rangle.$$

Check normalization: $3/4 + 1/4 = 1$. In the Bloch parametrization: $\cos(\theta/2) = \sqrt{3}/2$ gives $\theta = \pi/3$; the coefficient of $|1\rangle$ is $i/2 = e^{i\pi/2}/2$, so $\phi = \pi/2$.

**Measuring** $\sigma_z$.

$$P(\sigma_z = +1) = |\langle 0|\psi\rangle|^2 = 3/4, \qquad P(\sigma_z = -1) = |\langle 1|\psi\rangle|^2 = 1/4.$$

Expectation value: $\langle\sigma_z\rangle = (+1)(3/4) + (-1)(1/4) = 1/2$. From the Bloch vector: $\langle\sigma_z\rangle = \cos\theta = \cos(\pi/3) = 1/2$. Consistent. Variance: $\sigma_{\sigma_z}^2 = 1 - (1/2)^2 = 3/4$.

Post-measurement states: if $+1$, collapse to $|0\rangle$; subsequent $\sigma_z$ gives $+1$ with probability 1. If $-1$, collapse to $|1\rangle$; subsequent $\sigma_z$ gives $-1$ with probability 1.

**Measuring** $\sigma_x$.

The $\sigma_x$ eigenstates are $|\pm x\rangle = (|0\rangle \pm |1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$.

$$P(\sigma_x = +1) = |\langle +x|\psi\rangle|^2 = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{i}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{3+1}{8} = \frac{1}{2}.$$

So $\langle\sigma_x\rangle = 0$. From the Bloch vector: $\sin\theta\cos\phi = \sin(\pi/3)\cos(\pi/2) = 0$. Consistent.

**Measuring** $\sigma_y$.

The $\sigma_y$ eigenstates are $|{\pm}y\rangle = (|0\rangle \pm i|1\rangle)/\sqrt{2}$.

$$P(\sigma_y = +1) = \left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}}\cdot\frac{i}{2}\right|^2 = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}/2 + 1/2}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{(\sqrt{3}+1)^2}{8} = \frac{2+\sqrt{3}}{4} \approx 0.933.$$

So $\langle\sigma_y\rangle \approx 0.933 - 0.067 = \sqrt{3}/2$. Bloch vector: $\sin(\pi/3)\sin(\pi/2) = \sqrt{3}/2$. Consistent.

**The Robertson bound.**

$[\sigma_x, \sigma_z] = -2i\sigma_y$, so the bound on $\sigma_{\sigma_x}\sigma_{\sigma_z}$ is $|\langle\sigma_y\rangle| = \sqrt{3}/2$. We computed $\sigma_{\sigma_z} = \sqrt{3}/2$. For $\sigma_{\sigma_x}$: $\langle\sigma_x\rangle = 0$ and $\sigma_x^2 = \hat{I}$, so $\sigma_{\sigma_x} = 1$.

Product: $1 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2 = \sqrt{3}/2$. Bound: $\sqrt{3}/2$. They are equal — the Robertson bound is saturated. This state is the $\sigma_y$ eigenstate (confirmed by $P(\sigma_y = +1) \approx 0.933$). The $\sigma_y$ eigenstate maximizes the product $\sigma_{\sigma_x}\sigma_{\sigma_z}$ for the $(\sigma_x, \sigma_z)$ pair, because a point on the Bloch sphere lying entirely along the $y$-axis is equidistant from all $x$-axis and $z$-axis eigenstates.

**What changes for a generic state.** Pick $\theta = \pi/4$, $\phi = 0$. Then $\langle\sigma_y\rangle = 0$, and the Robertson bound gives $\sigma_{\sigma_x}\sigma_{\sigma_z} \geq 0$ — trivially satisfied by any non-negative numbers. Computing explicitly: $\sigma_{\sigma_x} = \sigma_{\sigma_z} = 1/\sqrt{2}$, product $= 1/2$, bound $= 0$. The bound holds but is not tight. The Robertson bound is a property of the state, not a fixed number. The simulation exercise makes this visible.
