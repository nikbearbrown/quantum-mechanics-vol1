# Chapter 2 — Matter Waves: de Broglie, Davisson–Germer, and the Double Slit

In 1924, Louis-Victor de Broglie proposed, in a doctoral thesis that his committee nearly rejected, that if light waves can behave like particles — as Einstein had shown with the photoelectric effect — then matter particles ought to behave like waves. Einstein had established that electromagnetic waves carry momentum $p = h/\lambda$. De Broglie reversed the relation: a particle with momentum $p$ should have an associated wavelength

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}.$$

Einstein, consulted by the committee before the thesis was approved, called the idea brilliant. De Broglie received the Nobel Prize in 1929. Two years after the thesis appeared, a laboratory accident in New Jersey provided experimental confirmation. Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer had been firing electrons at a polycrystalline nickel surface, recording a featureless scatter pattern. A laboratory accident contaminated the sample, and when they annealed the nickel to clean it, the polycrystalline target converted into a single crystal with regular atomic planes. On resuming their measurements, the smooth scatter pattern was gone; sharp diffraction peaks had appeared at specific angles. The electrons were diffracting from the crystal lattice exactly as X-rays do — confirming de Broglie's prediction through an experiment that was not designed for that purpose.

## The Formula and What It Means

Let us begin with what de Broglie actually wrote. For a non-relativistic particle with kinetic energy $K$ and mass $m$, energy and momentum are related by $K = p^2/2m$, so $p = \sqrt{2mK}$. Substituting gives

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mK}}.$$

For a charged particle of charge $e$ accelerated from rest through a potential difference $V$, the kinetic energy is $K = eV$, which gives

$$\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2meV}}.$$

For electrons in particular — a calculation you will do often — the numbers collapse into a convenient shortcut:

$$\lambda_{\text{electron}} \approx \frac{1.226\text{ nm}}{\sqrt{V\text{ (in volts)}}}.$$

At 150 volts, $\lambda \approx 0.1$ nm — one tenth of a nanometer, one ångström. This is no accident. It is roughly the spacing between atoms in a solid. For a wave to diffract from a crystal, its wavelength must be comparable to the crystal's spacing, which is why X-rays, with wavelengths in the ångström range, can do it. The de Broglie formula tells us that electrons accelerated through a few hundred volts land in exactly the same range. That is why Davisson and Germer could see diffraction at all, and why Bragg's law — developed entirely for X-rays — worked without modification for electrons.

It is important to be clear about what the wavelength is not. It is not the physical size of the electron. The classical electron radius is roughly $2.8 \times 10^{-15}$ m, eight orders of magnitude smaller than the 0.167 nm de Broglie wavelength of a 54 eV electron. The wavelength is a property of the electron's state of motion, not its physical extent. This distinction matters a great deal when you first encounter the idea, because the intuitive picture — a small ball with ripples around it — is simply wrong. The wave and the particle are not separable components of one object. In the sense that it is the only thing that evolves deterministically between observations, the wave *is* the thing.

<!-- → [TABLE: de Broglie wavelengths for several particles — columns: particle, mass, speed or energy, λ; rows: electron at 54 eV (the Davisson–Germer case), proton at same kinetic energy, C₆₀ buckyball at 900 K, 70 kg person walking at 1 m/s; the last row makes the classical limit visceral] -->

De Broglie's idea was not purely abstract, and its logical structure is worth tracing. Einstein's special relativity required that energy and momentum transform together as a four-vector. De Broglie noticed that frequency and wave vector (the spatial frequency $1/\lambda$) transform as a four-vector too. For a photon, the relation $E = h\nu$ links these two four-vectors through the single constant $h$. De Broglie asserted that the same constant links them for any particle. This was a symmetry argument, not an empirical fit; the experiments came afterward.

## The Davisson–Germer Experiment

We can reconstruct the 1927 result from first principles. For electrons accelerated through 54 V, Davisson and Germer recorded a sharp diffraction peak at 50°. The de Broglie wavelength at 54 eV is:

$$p = \sqrt{2 \times (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (54 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19})} = 3.970 \times 10^{-24}\text{ kg m s}^{-1}$$

$$\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{3.970 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 0.167\text{ nm.}$$

The crystal planes that matter here are nickel's (111) planes in the face-centered cubic lattice, separated by $d = 0.091$ nm. Bragg's law for first-order diffraction reads:

$$2d\sin\theta_{\text{Bragg}} = \lambda \implies \sin\theta_{\text{Bragg}} = \frac{0.167}{2 \times 0.091} = 0.918 \implies \theta_{\text{Bragg}} \approx 66.6°.$$

The scattering angle measured from the forward beam in the Davisson–Germer geometry converts to approximately 47° — close to the observed 50°. The small remaining discrepancy is not a failure of de Broglie. It arises because electrons entering a metal crystal experience an attractive inner potential, which slightly accelerates them and shortens their wavelength inside the crystal. Correcting for this inner potential brings the prediction into exact agreement.

This is what a successful quantitative test looks like: a parameter-free prediction built from quantities measured entirely independently ($h$, $m_e$, $d$), compared against an angle measured in an unrelated experiment that was not even designed to test the prediction. The agreement is not approximate. It is exact once the physics is fully accounted for.

Davisson and Germer did not at first fully understand what they had found. Davisson grasped it only after traveling to Europe and speaking with Max Born, James Franck, and others who had been absorbing de Broglie's and Schrödinger's new wave mechanics. Meanwhile George Paget Thomson was doing similar experiments independently in Aberdeen, firing electrons through thin metal films and observing rings — Debye–Scherrer diffraction, the same geometry used for polycrystalline X-ray diffraction. Thomson and Davisson shared the 1937 Nobel Prize. (Davisson–Germer, *Physical Review* **30**, 705–740 (1927). doi:10.1103/PhysRev.30.705)

<!-- → [FIGURE: diagram of Bragg diffraction geometry applied to the Davisson–Germer case — showing incident and reflected electron beams, crystal planes separated by d = 0.091 nm, path-length difference of 2d sin θ, and the condition for constructive interference; contrast with a polycrystalline diffraction ring geometry for Thomson's version] -->

*Figure 2.2 — diagram of Bragg diffraction geometry applied to the Davisson–Germer case — showing incident and reflected electron beams, crystal planes…*

One point of logic should be made explicit. The Davisson–Germer experiment does not prove that electrons *are* waves in any classical sense — that they are extended oscillations in a medium, the way sound is. What it proves is that electrons produce interference and diffraction that can only be calculated using wave mechanics. The distinction matters because the very same electron that contributes to a diffraction peak arrives at the detector as a localized event: a single click, a single dot.

## Single Electrons, One at a Time

Akira Tonomura and colleagues at Hitachi performed a particularly instructive version of the double-slit experiment in 1989. They used an electron biprism — a fine wire held at positive potential that splits an electron beam into two coherent paths, physically equivalent to two slits — and reduced the beam intensity until fewer than one electron was in the apparatus at any moment. Each electron was recorded as a single localized dot on a position-sensitive detector.

The accumulated pattern builds in a characteristic way. At ten electrons, the dots appear randomly distributed, with no evident order. By two hundred electrons, faint clustering appears. By six thousand, stripes begin to form. By seventy thousand, the result is a clear interference pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes — the pattern that wave mechanics predicts when a wave passes through both paths.

Each electron in this experiment arrived as a particle — a single localized dot — and was detected individually. Yet the distribution of those dots, after many electrons, matches the interference pattern $|\psi|^2$ computed from the wave function for a wave that passed through both paths. The electrons did not interfere with each other; there was only ever one in the apparatus at a time. Each electron's wave function explored both arms simultaneously and interfered with itself. The dot on the detector marks where the wave function collapsed upon measurement.

Tonomura's 1989 paper is the most famous experiment of this kind, but it was not the first. Pier Giorgio Merli, Giulio Missiroli, and Gianfranco Pozzi demonstrated single-electron buildup in Bologna in 1974 (published in 1976 in the *American Journal of Physics*), and a 2002 *Physics World* poll voted their experiment one of the most beautiful in physics. The first version to use genuine nano-fabricated double slits — real slits cut into a membrane rather than a biprism — came later, with Bach et al. in 2013. (Tonomura et al., *Am. J. Phys.* **57**, 117–120 (1989). doi:10.1119/1.16104; Bach et al., *New J. Phys.* **15**, 033018 (2013). doi:10.1088/1367-2630/15/3/033018)

<!-- → [CHART: sequence of detector images from the single-electron buildup — showing the pattern at approximately 10, 200, 6,000, and 70,000 electrons; this is the most important visual in the chapter and must show both the particle nature (individual dots) and wave nature (emerging fringes)] -->

![sequence of detector images from the single-electron buildup — showing the pattern at approximately 10, 200, 6,000, and 70,000 electrons](../images/02-matter-waves-fig-03.png)
*Figure 2.3 — sequence of detector images from the single-electron buildup — showing the pattern at approximately 10, 200, 6,000, and 70,000 electrons*

The experiment rules out any model in which the electron follows a definite trajectory through one slit or the other. If electrons had definite trajectories, reducing the beam to one electron at a time would not change the outcome — you would see two bright regions, one behind each slit, with no fringes between them. Instead, fringes appear well into the geometric shadow, and the pattern depends on the separation of both slits even though each electron can only be detected in one place.

One might propose that the electron goes through one slit but is disturbed by the act of not detecting it at the other. This is not supported by experiment. The slits can be made arbitrarily wide and the detection system arbitrarily gentle, and the interference persists as long as information about which slit the electron used is not acquired. What destroys interference is not physical disturbance — it is information.

## Why Human-Scale Objects Do Not Diffract

The de Broglie relation applies to all objects with momentum, not only to quantum particles. The relevant question is whether the associated wavelength is large enough to produce observable interference.

A proton accelerated through the same 54 V has 1836 times the electron's mass. At the same kinetic energy its momentum is $\sqrt{1836}$ times larger, so its wavelength is $\sqrt{1836} \approx 43$ times smaller: about 4 pm. That is still within reach of crystal diffraction — neutron and proton diffraction are real techniques used in materials science.

A $\text{C}_{60}$ buckyball — sixty carbon atoms, mass roughly 720 atomic mass units — was diffracted from a grating with 50 nm slits by Anton Zeilinger's group in Vienna in 1999. The de Broglie wavelength at the effusion temperature of 900 K works out to roughly 2.5 pm (picometers), smaller than the molecule itself. Yet fringes appeared. The 2019 experiments by Fein and colleagues pushed this to molecules of approximately 2,000 atoms. (Arndt et al., *Nature* **401**, 680–682 (1999). doi:10.1038/44348; Fein et al., *Nat. Phys.* **15**, 1242–1245 (2019). doi:10.1038/s41567-019-0663-9)

Now compute the wavelength of a 70 kg person walking at 1 m/s:

$$\lambda = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{70 \times 1} \approx 10^{-35}\text{ m.}$$

That is approximately twenty orders of magnitude smaller than a proton radius. No physical slit, crystal lattice, or instrument could resolve a wavelength this small. Quantum interference is not absent for large objects — it is present but completely undetectable. Quantum mechanics is not wrong at human scales; the wavelengths are simply too small for any realizable grating or aperture to reveal the fringe structure. This is Bohr's correspondence principle made quantitative: quantum mechanics contains classical mechanics as the limit in which the system's action greatly exceeds $\hbar$. The de Broglie wavelength makes that limit concrete — computing $h/p$ is sufficient.

## What the Wave Function Is Not Yet

De Broglie established that there is a wave associated with a moving particle, but did not say what the wave represents. That question was answered by Max Born in 1926. Born proposed that the wave function $\psi(x,t)$ is not a physical wave in space, like a water wave or a sound wave. Its square modulus, $|\psi(x,t)|^2$, is a probability density: the probability per unit length of finding the particle at position $x$ at time $t$.

This interpretation is not derivable from the de Broglie relation. It is a separate postulate, and it is the one that makes quantum mechanics quantitatively predictive. The wave function is complex-valued and not directly observable, but it predicts observable interference phenomena.

The Tonomura experiment illustrates Born's rule. The interference pattern that accumulates, dot by dot, matches the pattern $|\psi|^2$ predicts from the wave equation. Individual dots appear at random positions — no single electron's landing point can be predicted. After many electrons, the distribution converges to $|\psi|^2$. This randomness is not, as far as we know, the result of ignorance about some underlying hidden variables. It is a fundamental feature of the theory.

The connection between the de Broglie wavelength and the wave function is exact, not merely analogical. A state of definite momentum $p$ corresponds to the plane wave $\psi(x) \propto e^{ipx/\hbar}$, which has spatial period $\lambda = h/p = 2\pi\hbar/p$ — precisely de Broglie's wavelength, now appearing as the spatial period of the quantum state. Chapter 3 develops what the wave function means precisely, how it is normalized, and why $|\psi|^2$ gives probabilities. Chapter 4 provides the equation of motion.

One consequence of this connection is worth noting before moving on. A state of definite momentum extends over all space — a plane wave $e^{ipx/\hbar}$ has no spatial localization at all. To build a localized particle, we must superpose plane waves over a range of momenta $\Delta p$, which produces spatial localization within a width $\Delta x \sim h/\Delta p$. This is a result from Fourier analysis, and it will become, in the next chapter, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Estimate the most probable speed using $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{3}{2}k_BT$ and compute $\lambda$. Compare $\lambda$ to the 50 nm slit spacing used in the experiment. Does the smallness of $\lambda$ relative to the slit surprise you? What does it tell you about the sensitivity of the detection technique required?
   *Tests: de Broglie calculation for a mesoscopic object, and intuition about why large-molecule diffraction is experimentally demanding.*

7. *Difficulty: Synthesis — connects Born's rule to the Tonomura buildup.*
   Tonomura's experiment records electrons one at a time, each as a single dot. (a) If electrons followed definite classical trajectories through one slit or the other, what pattern would accumulate on the detector? Draw or describe it. (b) The actual pattern is an interference fringe. What does this imply about each electron's wave function as it traverses the apparatus? (c) A student argues: "Maybe the electrons interact with the metal walls of the biprism and get deflected into fringes — no wave function needed." Design a modification of the experiment that would rule this out.

(a) What is $\Delta x$ (the spatial uncertainty) for this state? What is $\Delta p$? (b) Now suppose you superpose plane waves over a momentum range $\Delta p$ centered on $p_0$. Argue qualitatively, using the Fourier relationship between a wave packet's width and its frequency content, that the resulting spatial width satisfies $\Delta x \sim h/\Delta p$. (c) Identify the chapter's statement that anticipates this result without yet calling it the uncertainty principle.
   *Tests: whether the student can connect the de Broglie wavelength to the uncertainty principle through the logic of wave superposition.*

**Challenge**
